Go 1.24 is shaping up to be a significant release, introducing a range of enhancements focused on performance, security, and developer experience. These changes aim to make Go even more powerful and efficient for building modern applications.

## Performance Boost

A general performance improvement with a 2-3% reduction in CPU overhead across a suite of representative benchmarks. These improvements include a new built-in map implementation, more efficient memory allocation of small objects, and a new runtime-internal mutex implementation. Results may vary by application.

## Post-Quantum Crypto

Introduction of the `crypto/mlkem` package, implementing ML-KEM-768 and ML-KEM-1024. ML-KEM is a post-quantum key exchange mechanism formerly known as Kyber and specified in FIPS 203. This addition prepares Go for the future of cryptographic security.

## TLS Enhancement

Support for Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) in TLS. This feature can be enabled by populating the `Config.EncryptedClientHelloKeys` field, enhancing privacy and security for TLS connections.

## New Swiss Table Map

An enhanced map implementation for better performance. This new implementation is based on Swiss Tables, and can be disabled with the `GOEXPERIMENT=noswissmap` build flag.

## Sync Map Update

Improved performance for map modifications in `sync.Map`. Modifications of disjoint sets of keys are much less likely to contend on larger maps, and there is no longer any ramp-up time required to achieve low-contention loads from the map. If you encounter issues, you can revert to the old implementation using `GOEXPERIMENT=nosynchashtriemap`.

## Enhanced JSON Marshaling

A new `omitempty` tag option for smarter struct field omission during JSON marshaling. When marshaling, a struct field with the `omitempty` option will be omitted if its value is zero. If the field type has an `IsZero() bool` method, that will be used to determine whether the value is zero.

## Runtime Cleanup

Introduction of `AddCleanup` function to replace `SetFinalizer` for better resource management. Unlike `SetFinalizer`, it does not resurrect the object it is attached to for finalization, and multiple cleanups may be attached to a single object. New code should prefer `AddCleanup` over `SetFinalizer`.

## Tool Directives in go.mod

Improved executable dependency tracking using tool directives in `go.mod`. This removes the need for the previous workaround of adding tools as blank imports to a file conventionally named “tools.go”.

## Directory-Limited Access

New `os.Root` type for controlled filesystem operations. The `os.Root` type provides the ability to perform filesystem operations within a specific directory, preventing access outside of the specified path.

## Testing Improvements

New `testing/synctest` package for testing concurrent code. The `synctest.Run` function starts a group of goroutines in an isolated “bubble”, and `synctest.Wait` function waits for all goroutines in the current bubble to block. This package is experimental and must be enabled by setting `GOEXPERIMENT=synctest` at build time.

## Build Cache

`go run` executables are now cached for faster execution. This makes repeated executions faster at the expense of making the cache larger.

## Cgo Performance

New `#cgo noescape` and `#cgo nocallback` annotations for better Cgo performance. `#cgo noescape cFunctionName` tells the compiler that memory passed to the C function does not escape. `#cgo nocallback cFunctionName` tells the compiler that the C function does not call back to any Go functions.

## Weak Pointers

Support for weak pointers to safely reference memory without preventing reclamation. Weak pointers are a low-level primitive provided to enable the creation of memory-efficient structures, such as weak maps for associating values, canonicalizations maps, and various kinds of caches.

## Benchmark Improvement

New `testing.B.Loop` method for faster, less error-prone benchmarks. The benchmark function will execute exactly once per `-count`, so expensive setup and cleanup steps execute only once. Function call parameters and results are kept alive, preventing the compiler from fully optimizing away the loop body.

Go 1.24 is shaping up to be a significant release, offering substantial improvements in various aspects of the language and its ecosystem.
